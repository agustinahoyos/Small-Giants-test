# Small-Giants-test
React App 


 For this test I have used javascript, create react app, react hooks, react router, axios, bootstrap, css, node,
 cors and express to make a real simple  app  connected to the Mercado Libre API. This can be easily exchanged for another API.
 
 To run the project:
  From Api folder: 
 -npm install
 -npm start

 From client folder: 
 -npm install
 -npm start
